**Mission**: to provide user-friendly demos using python. Users can run them locally. Moreover, developers can dubug them locally to identify bugs; however, using notebooks is impossible.


**Principles**: 

1) Do not define any function, and put the functins to python files out of tutorials_notebook and tutorials_python.
2) The codes will be copied to the corresponding notebook in tutorials_notebook.


## File Structure

There are five parts.

Part Introduction: basic demos, which are prepared for beginners.

Part Advance: advanced demos, e.g., ensemble stock trading.

Part Practical: paper trading and live trading (in the future).

Part Optimization: hyperparameter tuning.

Part Others: other demos.
